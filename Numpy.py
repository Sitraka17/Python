#What is NumPy?
#NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing in Python. 
#It is a Python library that provides a multidimensional array object, various derived objects (such as masked arrays and matrices),
#and an assortment of routines for fast operations on arrays, including mathematical, logical, shape manipulation, 
#sorting, selecting, I/O, discrete Fourier transforms, basic linear algebra, basic statistical operations, random simulation and much more.

### EXAMPLES from DC 
# baseball is available as a regular list of lists
# updated is available as 2D numpy array

# Import numpy package
import numpy as np

# Create np_baseball (3 cols)
np_baseball = np.array(baseball)

# Print out addition of np_baseball and updated
print(np_baseball + updated)

# Create numpy array: conversion
conversion = np.array([0.0254,0.453592,1])

# Print out product of np_baseball and conversion
print(np_baseball*conversion)
--------------------------------------------------------------------
# np_baseball is available
# Import numpy
import numpy as np

# Print mean height (first column)
avg = np.mean(np_baseball[:,0])
print("Average: " + str(avg))

# Print median height. Replace 'None'
med = np.median(np_baseball)
print("Median: " + str(med))

# Print out the standard deviation on height. Replace 'None'
stddev = np.std(np_baseball[:,0])
print("Standard Deviation: " + str(stddev))

# Print out correlation between first and second column. Replace 'None'
corr = np.corrcoef(np_baseball[:,0],np_baseball[:,1])
print("Correlation: " + str(corr))

# Convert positions and heights to numpy arrays: np_positions, np_heights
np_positions = np.array(positions)
np_heights = np.array(heights)

# Heights of the goalkeepers: gk_heights
gk_heights = np_heights[np_positions == 'GK']

# Heights of the other players: other_heights
other_heights = np_heights[np_positions != 'GK']

# Print out the median height of goalkeepers. Replace 'None'
print("Median height of goalkeepers: " + str(np.median(gk_heights)))

# Print out the median height of other players. Replace 'None'
print("Median height of other players: " + str(np.median(other_heights)))
